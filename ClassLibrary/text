//the term state is used to describe the condition of the execution environment at a specific moment in time. As your code executes line by line, values are stored in variables. At any moment during execution, 
//the current state of the application is the collection of all values stored in memory.
//stateless methods are implemented so that they can work without referencing or changing any values already stored in memory.
//Stateless methods are also known as static methods.
//stateful methods are built in such a way that they rely on values stored
  //in memory by previous lines of code that have already been execu
The new operator does several important things:

It first requests an address in the computer's memory large enough to store a new object based on the Random class.
It creates the new object, and stores it at the memory address.
It returns the memory address so that it can be saved in the dice object.

When calling a stateless method, you don't need to create a new instance of its class first.
When calling a stateful method, you need to create an instance of the class, and access the method on the object.
Use the new operator to create a new instance of a class.
An instance of a class is called an object.
'parameter' refers to the variable that's being used inside the method. An 'argument' is the value that's passed when the method is called.
Methods use a method signature to define the number of parameters that the method will accept, as well as the data type of each parameter
